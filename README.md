# Network Diagram Research Map

This was an Air Force sponsored project during the Discovery Lab Global 10 week Artificial Intelligence program. The sponsor representative Mr. Sherry requested our team to create a system to help researchers share, collaborate, and visualize information in virtual reality. There were three teams of three students each. I used my position as a team lead to prep my team on foundational material and collaborate on several programming tasks in Python and the Linden Scripting Language. 

This project scrapes sciencedirect.com for details on research papers (title, description, authors, location, and email) regarding any topic or author chosen by the user and plots the details on a world map in the Second Life virtual reality environment. This research map allows the user to view where the most current research occurs around the globe. If an author is chosen for the search query over a topic then the world map will effectively display the scope of an author's worldwide influence when publishing research.
